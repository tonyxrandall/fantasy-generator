# Fantasy Toolkit — Generators (React + Vite)

A single‑page app with generators for **Names**, **Jobs**, **Items**, **Locations**, and **NPCs**.
All data is stored locally using `localStorage` — no server required.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open the printed local URL.

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Add more names
Put additional names (one per line) into `public/names_extra.txt` and hard refresh.
You can also edit the in‑app "Names library".
